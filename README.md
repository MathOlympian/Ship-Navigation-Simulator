I modified this starter ship simulator to illustrate certain concepts. 

You can change the camera to first person view. 

Download / Clone the project folder. Open Ship_Behaviour_Modelling_HD.exe

Navigation Instructions

- Hold Key W on the keyboard to rev up engine rpm until ship begins to move.
