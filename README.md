# Ship Movement Behaviour Modelled

I have modified this starter ship simulator to illustrate certain concepts. 

You can change the camera to first person view. 

Navigation Instructions

- Hold Key W on the keyboard to rev up engine rpm until ship begins to move.
- Use Key S to brake.
- Use Key A and D for rudder controls

Enjoy
